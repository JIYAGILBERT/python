# b=input('Enter the word to replace:')
# c=input('Enter a new word:')
# d=a.replace(b,c)
# print(d)


# 10. Split a String into Words Write a Python program that splits a string into a list of words based on spaces.

# a=["jiya", "sandra","aishu"]
# b= " ".join(a)
# print(b)

# 12. Check if a String Contains a Substring Write a Python program that asks the user for a substring and checks if it is present anywhere in the given string.

# print(b)
# c=input("enter a string:")
# for i in b:
#     if i==c:
#         print('Word exist')
#         break
# else: 
#     print('word does not exist')
